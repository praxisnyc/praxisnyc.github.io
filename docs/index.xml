      <description>Praxis is a fuzzy cloud, a portal to the stars, an epic twirl in the middle of the dancefloor.
Praxis has taken many forms over the past 6 years &amp;ndash; book club, design collective, queens of the scene, think tank, and more &amp;ndash; and as the year closes, we wanted to use this space to muse a bit about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to over the past year and where we are trying to go in the next.</description>

 View phases list view categories draft  What can I help you with the most? Is this a better way to track initiatives? Any other standards we could be using? How to communicate initiative&amp;rsquo;s status so others know where we stand?</description>

      <description>Brainbound The (nonneural) body is just the sensor and effector system of the brain, and the world is just the arena in which adaptive problems get posed and in which the brain–body system must sense and act. All human cognition depends directly on neural activity alone.    Extended Includes inextricable tangles of feedback, feed-forward, and feed-around loops: loops that promiscuously criss-cross the boundaries of brain, body, and world.</description>
