### A framework for collaboration that reduces transaction costs via a handshake protocol that determines what agents can do together and ways to work

#### Unbundling of Companies // Degrowth // Worker-centric model

One of the main reasons organizations grow monolithic is to cut transaction costs. LLMs allows us to slash these cost, allowing them to stay lean, specialized, and agile—while still collaborating dynamically.

This is a new kind of ecosystem, where institutions don’t just interact, they sense each other—like constellations in space—through handshake protocols and smart contracts. These protocols automate middle management, intelligently identifying:

- *How* organizations should collaborate (based on operational compatibility)
- *What* they should collaborate on (matching mutual needs in real-time, maybe even proposing smart contracts)

Each institution’s orbit adapts based on scope and function, forming a network of autonomous yet hyper-connected entities, breaking free from bureaucratic scaling.

## Breaking from Growth: The Nimble-Ready Alternative

Nimble institutions reject the growth trap by prioritizing sustainability, adaptability, and interdependence over scale. Instead of becoming monoliths, they thrive through:

1. **Protocol-Driven Collaboration** – Standardized handshake protocols enable seamless partnerships without mergers
1. **Sovereignty Through Specialization** – Master one domain, connect with others instead of expanding aimlessly
1. **Dynamic Orbits** – Stay fluid, shifting roles based on opportunity, not rigid hierarchies
1. **Automated Middle Management** – LLMs replace bureaucratic overhead, ensuring efficiency
1. **Resilience by Design** – Modular, decentralized, and adaptable, not dependent on sheer size
1. **Value Over Scale** – Impact, efficiency, and autonomy define success—not expansion
1. **Networked Anti-Fragility** – Essential to the ecosystem, reducing the risk of obsolescence or acquisition

#### Nimble institutions don’t need to **grow**—they need to be **impossible to replace**.
