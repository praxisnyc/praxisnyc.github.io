This idea of making institutions nimble-proof has strong connections with some existing theories and concepts. Let me list a few that might help you structure this proposal better:

Agile Organizations Theory: Focused on flexibility, quick adaptation, and autonomous teams. Although widely applied in technology, the concept can be adapted for broader organizations.

Theory of the Firm (Transaction Cost Economics): By Ronald Coase, it explains why companies grow to avoid transaction costs in the market. Your idea challenges this by proposing LLMs to reduce these costs between independent institutions.

Exponential Organizations (ExO): Popularized by Salim Ismail, it addresses companies that scale rapidly by using technology to reduce costs and increase impact, aligning with the automation of communication via LLM.

Complex Systems and Network Theory: Studies how decentralized systems organize and collaborate. This could inspire how different institutions might interact without rigid hierarchies.

Organizational Modularity: Advocates creating autonomous units that can be recombined for different projects. The Handshake Protocol could act as the glue between these modules.

Interoperability Protocols: In technology, protocols like TCP/IP or APIs define how different systems communicate. Adapting this concept for organizations could be a pathway forward.

Distributed Governance and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations): Explores forms of governance without hierarchies, where rules are automated via smart contracts. This could inspire the automation of agreements between institutions.
