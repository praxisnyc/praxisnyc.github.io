For this round, we’re studying  how to disengage from neoliberal and hyper individualistic traps. Leaning into the praxis of it all, we’ll study historical cases, any medium on how people have disengaged from 

- mainstream media, 
- unhealthy relationships, 
- unjust financial terms, 
- etc.

### Do you have a case study you can share? 

By case study, we mean any sort of writings (blogs, articles, books, anything) and videos that spotlight how others have thought for themselves across these topics. 

Do you wanna join us? Email us at [hello@praxis.nyc](mailto:hello@praxis.nyc?subject=disengagement%20historical%20cases)
