### A framework for collaboration that reduxes X cost via a handshake protocol that determines what agents can do and ways that we can work 

#### Unbundling of Companies // Degrowth // Worker-centric model

---

One of the main reasons organizations grow monolithic is to cut transaction costs. LLMs allows us to slash these cost, allowing them to stay lean, specialized, and agile—while still collaborating dynamically.

This is a new kind of ecosystem, where institutions don’t just interact, they sense each other—like constellations in space—through handshake protocols and smart contracts. These protocols automate middle management, intelligently identifying:

*How* organizations should collaborate (based on operational compatibility)

*What* they should collaborate on (matching mutual needs in real-time, maybe even proposing smart contracts)

Each institution’s orbit adapts based on scope and function, forming a network of autonomous yet hyper-connected entities, breaking free from bureaucratic scaling.

## Breaking from Growth: The Nimble-Ready Alternative

Nimble institutions reject the growth trap by prioritizing sustainability, adaptability, and interdependence over scale. Instead of becoming monoliths, they thrive through:

1. **Protocol-Driven Collaboration** – Standardized handshake protocols enable seamless partnerships without mergers
1. **Sovereignty Through Specialization** – Master one domain, connect with others instead of expanding aimlessly
1. **Dynamic Orbits** – Stay fluid, shifting roles based on opportunity, not rigid hierarchies
1. **Automated Middle Management** – LLMs replace bureaucratic overhead, ensuring efficiency
1. **Resilience by Design** – Modular, decentralized, and adaptable, not dependent on sheer size
1. **Value Over Scale** – Impact, efficiency, and autonomy define success—not expansion
1. **Networked Anti-Fragility** – Essential to the ecosystem, reducing the risk of obsolescence or acquisition

Nimble institutions don’t need to **grow**—they need to be **impossible to replace**.

## Related concepts

This idea of making institutions nimble-proof has strong connections with some existing theories and concepts. Let me list a few that might help you structure this proposal better:

Agile Organizations Theory: Focused on flexibility, quick adaptation, and autonomous teams. Although widely applied in technology, the concept can be adapted for broader organizations.

Theory of the Firm (Transaction Cost Economics): By Ronald Coase, it explains why companies grow to avoid transaction costs in the market. Your idea challenges this by proposing LLMs to reduce these costs between independent institutions.

Exponential Organizations (ExO): Popularized by Salim Ismail, it addresses companies that scale rapidly by using technology to reduce costs and increase impact, aligning with the automation of communication via LLM.

Complex Systems and Network Theory: Studies how decentralized systems organize and collaborate. This could inspire how different institutions might interact without rigid hierarchies.

Organizational Modularity: Advocates creating autonomous units that can be recombined for different projects. The Handshake Protocol could act as the glue between these modules.

Interoperability Protocols: In technology, protocols like TCP/IP or APIs define how different systems communicate. Adapting this concept for organizations could be a pathway forward.

Distributed Governance and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations): Explores forms of governance without hierarchies, where rules are automated via smart contracts. This could inspire the automation of agreements between institutions.
