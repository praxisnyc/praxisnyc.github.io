# What's done

Check github history and update done.md accordingly.

**Formatting rules:**

- Each entry must be a single line, with emoji, commit link, summary, and date, e.g.:
  `🔧 [commit message](commit link): Explanation of commit, what changed and possibly why. (YYYY-MM-DD)`
- List commits in **reverse chronological order** (most recent first) within each month.
- Do **not** remove or alter previous entries—just append new ones.
- Add month headers (e.g. `## December 2025`) as you move through the list, if new months are present.
- Include datestamp for each commit entry at the end of the line.

**Commit types are emojis:**

🔧 - fixes, mostly global
🎨 - creations
📄 - documentation
🐞 - debugging
