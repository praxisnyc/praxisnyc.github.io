When invoked, do the following:

- Inspect my recent flow and history, asking any permissions you need for a complete picture.
- Identify repeating, boring, or error-prone tasks in my workflow.
- Suggest automation ideas (tasks, scripts, keybindings, extensions, integrations, etc.) to reduce friction and save time.
- Suggest things to learn (workflows, tools, best practices) that could improve my flow and productivity.
